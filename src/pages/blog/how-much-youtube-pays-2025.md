|----------------|--------------------|
| 🇺🇸 USA         | $4 - $12            |
| 🇬🇧 UK          | $3 - $10            |
| 🇮🇳 India       | $0.5 - $2           |

## 🎯 Factors That Affect YouTube Earnings

1. **Location of viewers** – US/UK views pay more than India or Brazil.
2. **Niche** – Finance > Tech > Entertainment.
3. **Watch Time** – Longer videos = more ads.
4. **Ad Types** – Skippable, display, bumper, etc.
5. **Time of Year** – December = highest CPM.

## 📈 Example Calculation

If a channel gets 100,000 views/month with $2.5 RPM:

100,000 views / 1,000 = 100 blocks
100 × $2.5 = $250/month
